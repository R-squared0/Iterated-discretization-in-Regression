# Iterated-discretization-in-Regression
The aim of this project is to be able to predict the semi-major axis (named as pl$_$orbsmax) of exoplanet orbits from the given data set consisting of 289 features and 17969 data points. As the data set contains many NAN values and shifted rows, we first need to clean it and handle to missing values in order to make the data use able. Since this problem is based on predicting a continuous target variable: pl$_$orbsmax, we initially expected to solve the problem using regression techniques. As would be discussed ahead in detail, we finally came up with the 'Iterated Target Variable Discretization' algorithm and turned our regression problem into a classification problem, to get the best possible performance. \\
